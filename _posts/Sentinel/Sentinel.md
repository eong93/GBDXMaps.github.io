With the introduction of Sentinel 2 data on GBDX, a variety of insights to our ever changing planet can be gained. Land features like reservoirs, agriculture, glaciers, etc. can all be monitored and examined using the 10 meter resolution imagery collected by Sentinel 2. Also, as a result of its potential 5 day revisit rate the frequent changes that occur in our environment can be quickly detected; for example, flooding that occurred in Sri Lanka was captured before the storm surge receded.

Using analytical tools already available on GBDX, water can be extracted into vectors from pre and post event imagery to help determine impacted areas.

In a previous post, water extractions derived from Landsat-8 imagery were used to monitor Oroville Lake and based on measurements taken from water level instruments at the reservoir it was determined that accurate trends could be discovered. Water extractions derived from Sentinel-2 suggest the same kind of monitoring can be accomplished with similar accuracy according to the ground truth measurements provided by water resource department of California.

Since the Oroville Lake case study asserts that this kind of monitoring is viable, the opportunity to take advantage of GBDXâ€™s scalability and image catalog depth is presented. In contrast to Oroville Lake, where daily accurate water metrics are recorded and published for free, there are reservoirs in the world that do not possess such infrastructure to capture that kind of data nor do the responsible municipalities make it readily available; however, with GBDX that information can still be gathered. For example, Zhuzhuang Reservoir in China and Sidi Salem Dam. The graph spike occurring in July 2016 for the ZhuZhaung image below represents a flooding event.

While Sentinel-2 imagery alone can be used to produce valuable insights, in conjunction with Landsat-8, or even with DigitalGlobe sensors, a more in-depth image stack can be generated for enhanced monitoring to allow for greater situational awareness.
